## Current Implementation technologies

- Nextjs with Typescript.
- Static pages/ Server side rendering.
- Easy peasy state management (Might not need it with in-built Nextjs data fetching methods).
- Serverless APIs.
- Graphql with NexusJS.
- Code-first Grapqhl with single endpoint following Graphql spec sheet. (Nexus also generates the SDL declarative graphql schema)
- Prisma ORM.
- Tailwind
- Framer motion
- Postgres Database
